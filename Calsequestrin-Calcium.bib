abstract = {Recent experimental studies (Pusch and Neher, 1988) and theoretical studies (Oliva et al., 1988) have found that the pipette tip is a significant barrier to diffusion in the whole cell patch clamp configuration. In this paper, we extend the theoretical analysis of fluxes between the pipette and cell to include transmembrane fluxes. The general conclusions are: (a) within the pipette, ion fluxes are driven primarily by diffusion rather than voltage gradients. (b) At steady state there is a concentration difference between the bulk pipette and intracellular solution that is described by delta c = jRp/Dp, where delta c = 1 mM for a flux, j = 1 fmol/s, through a pipette of resistance, Rp = 1 M omega, filled with a solution of resistivity, p = 100 omega --cm, given a solute diffusion coefficient, D = 10(-5) cm2/s. (c) The time to steady state is always accelerated by membrane transport, regardless of the direction of transport. We apply our analysis to the measurement of transport by the Na/K pump and Na/Ca exchanger in cells from the ventricles of mammalian heart. We find that the binding curve for intracellular Na+ to the Na/K pump will appear significantly less steep and more linear if one does not correct for the concentration difference between intracellular and pipette Na+. Similar shifts in the binding curve for extracellular Na+ to the Na/Ca exchanger can occur due to depletion of intracellular Ca(+)+ when the exchanger is stimulated. Lastly, in Appendix we analyze the effects of mobile and fixed intracellular buffers on the movement of Ca(+)+ between the pipette and cell. Fixed buffers greatly slow the time for equilibration of pipette and intracellular Ca(+)+. Mobile buffers act like a shuttle system, as they carry Ca(+)+ from pipette to cell then diffuse back when they are empty. Vigorous transport by the Na/Ca exchanger depletes mobile buffered calcium, thus stimulating diffusion from the pipette to match the rate of Ca(+)+ transport. Moreover, we find that binding of Ca(+)+ to the exchanger can be affected by the mobile buffer.},

abstract = {Sarcoplasmic reticulum contains the internal Ca2+ store in smooth muscle cells and its lumen appears to be a continuum that lacks diffusion barriers. Accordingly, the free luminal Ca2+ level is the same all throughout the SR; however, whether the Ca2+ buffer capacity is the same in all the SR is unknown. We have estimated indirectly the luminal Ca2+ buffer capacity of the SR by comparing the reduction in SR Ca2+ levels with the corresponding increase in [Ca2+]i during activation of either IP3Rs with carbachol or RyRs with caffeine, in smooth muscle cells from guinea pig urinary bladder. We have determined that carbachol-sensitive SR has a 2.4 times larger Ca2+ buffer capacity than caffeine-sensitive SR. Rapid inhibition of SERCA pumps with thapsigargin revealed that this pump activity accounts for 80{\%} and 60{\%} of the Ca2+ buffer capacities of carbachol- and caffeine-sensitive SR, respectively. Moreover, the Ca2+ buffer capacity of carbachol-sensitive SR was similar to caffeine-sensitive SR when SERCA pumps were inhibited. Similar rates of Ca2+ replenishments suggest similar levels of SERCA pump activities for either carbachol- or caffeine-sensitive SR. Paired pulses of caffeine, in conditions of low Ca2+ influx, indicate the relevance of luminal SR Ca2+ buffer capacity in the [Ca2+]i response. To further study the importance of luminal SR Ca2+ buffer capacity in the release process we used low levels of heparin to partially inhibit IP3Rs. This condition revealed carbachol-induced transient increase of luminal SR Ca2+ levels provided that SERCA pumps were active. It thus appears that SERCA pump activity keeps the luminal SR Ca2+-binding proteins in the high-capacity, low-affinity conformation, particularly for IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release.},

abstract = {Thapsigargin-sensitive sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 21 pumps (SERCAs) are involved in maintaining and replenishing agonist-sensitive internal stores. Although it has been assumed that release channels act independently of SERCA pumps, there are data suggesting the opposite. Our aim was to study the relationship between SERCA pumps and the release channels in smooth muscle cells. To this end, we have rapidly blocked SERCA pumps with thapsigargin, to avoid depletion of the internal Ca 21 stores, and induced Ca 21 release with either caffeine, to open ryanodine receptors, or acetylcholine, to open inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Blocking SERCA pumps produced smaller and slower agonist-induced [Ca 21 ] i responses. We determined the Ca 21 level of the internal stores both indirectly, measuring the frequency of spontaneous transient outward currents, and directly, using Mag-Fura-2, and demonstrated that the inhibition of SERCA pumps did not produce a reduction of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 21 levels to explain the decrease in the agonist-induced Ca 21 responses. It appears that SERCA pumps are involved in sustaining agonist-induced Ca 21 release by a mechanism that involves the modulation of Ca 21 availability in the lumen of the internal stores.},

abstract = {The process of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) comprises 4 phases in smooth muscle cells. Phase 1 is characterized by a large increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with a minimal reduction of the free luminal SR [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]FSR). Importantly, active SR Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA pumps) are necessary for phase 1 to occur. This situation cannot be explained by the standard kinetics that involves a fixed amount of luminal Ca2+ binding sites. A new mathematical model was developed that assumes an increasing SR Ca2+ buffering capacity in response to an increase of the luminal SR [Ca2+] that is called Kinetics-on-Demand (KonD) model. This approach can explain both phase 1 and the refractory period associated with a recovered [Ca2+]FSR. Additionally, our data suggest that active SERCA pumps are a requisite for KonD to be functional; otherwise luminal SR Ca2+ binding proteins switch to standard kinetics. The importance of KonD Ca2+ binding properties is twofold: a more efficient Ca2+ release process and that [Ca2+]FSR and Ca2+-bound to SR proteins ([Ca2+]BSR) can be regulated separately allowing for Ca2+ release to occur (provided by Ca2+-bound to luminal Ca2+ binding proteins) without an initial reduction of the [Ca2+]FSR.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is a poorly selective channel that mediates Ca 2+ release from intracellular Ca 2+ stores. How RyR's selectivity between the physiological cations K + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ affects single-channel Ca 2+ current amplitude is examined using a recent model of RyR permeation. It is found that K + provides the vast majority of the countercurrent (through RyR itself) that is needed to prevent the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane potential from changing and stopping Ca 2+ release. Moreover, intra-pore competition between Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ defines single RyR Ca 2+ current amplitude. Since both [Mg 2+ ] and [Ca 2+ ] SR can change during pathophysiological conditions, the RyR unitary Ca 2+ current ampli-tude during Ca 2+ release may change significantly due to this Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ competition. Compared to the classic action of Mg 2+ on RyR open probability, these Ca 2+ current amplitude changes have as large or larger effects on overall RyR Ca 2+ mobilization. A new aspect of RyR divalent versus monovalent selectivity is also identified where this kind of selectivity decreases as divalent concentration increases.},

@article{Beard2004,
abstract = {Calsequestrin is by far the most abundant Ca2+-binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal and cardiac muscle. It allows the Ca2+ required for contraction to be stored at total concentrations of up to 20mM, while the free Ca2+ concentration remains at ∼1mM. This storage capacity confers upon muscle the ability to contract frequently with minimal run-down in tension. Calsequestrin is highly acidic, containing up to 50 Ca2+-binding sites, which are formed simply by clustering of two or more acidic residues. The Kd for Ca2+ binding is between 1 and 100$\mu$M, depending on the isoform, species and the presence of other cations. Calsequestrin monomers have a molecular mass of ∼40kDa and contain ∼400 residues. The monomer contains three domains each with a compact $\alpha$-helical/$\beta$-sheet thioredoxin fold which is stable in the presence of Ca2+. The protein polymerises when Ca2+ concentrations approach 1mM. The polymer is anchored at one end to ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channels either via the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin or by binding directly to the RyR. It is becoming clear that calsequestrin has several functions in the lumen of the SR in addition to its well-recognised role as a Ca2+ buffer. Firstly, it is a luminal regulator of RyR activity. When triadin and junctin are present, calsequestrin maximally inhibits the Ca2+ release channel when the free Ca2+ concentration in the SR lumen is 1mM. The inhibition is relieved when the Ca2+ concentration alters, either because of small changes in the conformation of calsequestrin or its dissociation from the junctional face membrane. These changes in calsequestrin's association with the RyR amplify the direct effects of luminal Ca2+ concentration on RyR activity. In addition, calsequestrin activates purified RyRs lacking triadin and junctin. Further roles for calsequestrin are indicated by the kinase activity of the protein, its thioredoxin-like structure and its influence over store operated Ca2+ entry. Clearly, calsequestrin plays a major role in calcium homeostasis that extends well beyond its ability to buffer Ca2+ ions.},

abstract = {The divalent calcium cation Ca2+ is used as a major signaling molecule during cell signal transduction to regulate energy output, cellular metabolism, and phenotype. The basis to the signaling role of Ca2+ is an intricate network of cellular channels and transporters that allow a low resting concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol of the cell (lCa2+1) but that are also coupled to major dynamic and rapidly exchanging stores. This enables extracellular signals from hormones and growth factors to be transduced as ICa2+li spikes that are amplitude and frequency encoded. There is considerable evidence that a number of toxic environmental chemicals target these Ca2+ signaling processes, alter them, and induce cell death by apoptosis. Two major pathways for apoptosis will be considered. The first one involves Ca2+-mediated expression of ligands that bind to and activate death receptors such as CD95 (Fas, APO-1). In the second pathway, Ca2+ has a direct toxic effect and its primary targets include the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mitochondria may respond to an apoptotic Ca2+ signal by the selective release of cytochrome c or through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and opening of an inner mitochondrial membrane pore. Toxic agents such as the environmental pollutant tributyltin or the natural plant product thapsigargin, which deplete the ER Ca2+ stores, will induce as a direct result of this effect the opening of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels and an ER stress response. In contrast, under some conditions, Ca2+ signals may be cytoprotective and antagonize the apoptotic machinery. -Environ Health Perspect 1 07(Suppl 1):25-35 (1999). The divalent calcium cation Ca2+ has a unique position among cellular ions in higher organisms. In its insoluble form, it is the major structural constituent of bones and teeth, whereas in its soluble form Ca2+ plays important roles such as membrane stabilizer, cofactor for proteins, electric charge carrier, and diffusible intracellular messenger (1,2). These roles result partly from the unusual distribution of soluble Ca2+ in the intracellular and extracellular environments and partly from the unique ability of Ca2+ to interact with proteins. The total Ca2+ concentration in extracellu-lar biologic fluids such as blood serum ranges from 1.6 to 2 mM (of which approximately 50{\%} is bound to proteins and other constituents). Within cells, Ca2+ is bound primarily to phospholipids, pro-teins, and nucleic acids or sequestered in organelles; only 0.1{\%} of the total cellular Ca2+ content is found free in the cytosol. Consequently, the cytosolic free Ca2+},

@article{Zhang1997,
abstract = {Several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for Ca 2؉ release. These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane. We recently puri-fied and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125 I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (Jones, L. R., Zhang, L., Sanborn, K., Jorgensen, A. O., and Kelley, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30787–30796). In the present study, we have examined the binding interactions be-tween the cardiac forms of these four proteins with em-phasis placed on the role of junctin. By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatog-raphy, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryano-dine receptor. This binding interaction is localized to the lumenal domain of junctin, which is highly enriched in charged amino acids organized into " KEKE " motifs. KEKE repeats are also found in the common lumenal domain of triadin, which likewise is capable of binding to calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (Guo, W., and Campbell, K. P. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9027–9030). It appears that junctin and triadin interact directly in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and stabilize a complex that anchors calsequestrin to the ryanodine receptor. Taken together, these results sug-gest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryano-dine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca 2؉ release. Ultrastructural and biochemical evidence suggests that a protein complex exists at the junctional SR 1 membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle to facilitate the release of Ca 2ϩ which occurs during muscle contraction (1– 4). Components of this protein complex identified to date include the ryanodine receptor or Ca 2ϩ release channel, which is visualized by elec-tron microscopy as projecting feet on the cytoplasmic surface of the junctional membrane (2, 4); calsequestrin, a high capacity Ca 2ϩ -binding protein located in the junctional SR lumen, which buffers the calcium that is released during muscle con-traction (5– 8); and triadin (9 –11) and junctin (8, 12), putative " anchoring " proteins, which appear to stabilize calsequestrin at the inner face of the junctional SR membrane. Calsequestrin is seen by electron microscopy as an electron-dense matrix in the SR lumen, where the protein appears to be physically con-nected to ryanodine receptors by " anchoring strands " (13) or " rope-like fibers " (14). Biochemical evidence suggests that calsequestrin actively participates in muscle contraction by regulating the amount of Ca 2ϩ released by the ryanodine re-ceptor (15–18). This regulatory effect may be mediated by calsequestrin-anchoring proteins such as triadin (19, 20) and junctin (8, 12). Junctin (8, 12) and triadin (11, 20) are integral membrane proteins sharing structural and amino acid sequence similarity which co-localize with the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin at the junctional SR membrane in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Junctin was first identified as a 26-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein in cardiac and skeletal muscle junctional SR mem-branes with use of an 125 I-calsequestrin filter overlay assay, where it was the main calsequestrin-binding protein detected (8). Based on this result, it was proposed that junctin was one of the proteins anchoring calsequestrin to the SR membrane. Subsequently, junctin was purified and cloned and shown to be identically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle (12). Tria-din was first identified as a 95-kDa protein in skeletal muscle junctional SR vesicles (9, 10). Subsequently, one skeletal mus-cle (11) and three cardiac (20) triadin isoforms were cloned. The cardiac triadin isoforms exhibit apparent molecular weights of 92,000 (triadin 3), 40,000 (triadin 2), and 35,000 (triadin 1) on SDS-PAGE. All triadin isoforms share identical sequences from residues 1–264. Although junctin and triadin are the products of different genes, they exhibit intriguing similarities. Both proteins have single membrane spanning domains that are 62{\%} identical, short N-terminal segments located in the cyto-plasm, and long C-terminal tails, which project intralumenally and are highly charged and basic (11, 12, 20). Notable in the lumenal domains of both proteins is the frequent occurrence of long runs of alternating positively and negatively charged res-idues, which are especially enriched in lysine and glutamic acid. Recurring sequences of this type have been described by others as " KEKE " association motifs and are thought to be involved in the promotion of several types of protein-protein binding interactions (21–23). A GST fusion protein containing the common lumenal domain of triadin, composed of residues 69 –264, and incorporating the KEKE regions was recently 1 The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propane-sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammino]-1-pro-panesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; N-junctin, GST fu-sion protein containing N-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of junctin; C-junctin, GST fusion protein containing C-terminal, lumenal domain of junctin; H-triadin, GST fusion protein containing homologous lume-nal domain of triadin.},

Each isoform was expressed efficiently and appeared to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. All isoforms displayed qualitatively similar enzymatic properties and were activated by calcium in a cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient of 2. The quantitative properties of SERCA1 and SERCA2a (the muscle isoforms) were identical in all respects. SERCA2b, however, appeared to have a lower turnover rate for both calcium transport and ATP hydrolysis. SERCA3 displayed a reduced apparent affinity for calcium, an increased apparent affinity for vanadate, and an altered pH dependence when compared with the other isoforms. These properties are consistent with an enzyme in which the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformations is shifted toward the E2 state.},

abstract = {Calsequestrin, the major calcium storage protein of both cardiac and skeletal muscle, binds and releases large numbers of Ca(2+) ions for each contraction and relaxation cycle. Here we show that two crystal structures for skeletal and cardiac calsequestrin are nearly superimposable not only for their subunits but also their front-to-front-type dimers. Ca(2+) binding curves were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. This method enables highly accurate measurements even for Ca(2+) bound to polymerized protein. The binding curves for both skeletal and cardiac calsequestrin were complex, with binding increases that correlated with protein dimerization, tetramerization, and oligomerization. The Ca(2+) binding capacities of skeletal and cardiac calsequestrin are directly compared for the first time, with approximately 80 Ca(2+) ions bound per skeletal calsequestrin and approximately 60 Ca(2+) ions per cardiac calsequestrin, as compared with net charges for these molecules of -80 and -69, respectively. Deleting the negatively charged and disordered C-terminal 27 amino acids of cardiac calsequestrin results in a 50{\%} reduction of its calcium binding capacity and a loss of Ca(2+)-dependent tetramer formation. Based on the crystal structures of rabbit skeletal muscle calsequestrin and canine cardiac calsequestrin, Ca(2+) binding capacity data, and previous light-scattering data, a mechanism of Ca(2+) binding coupled with polymerization is proposed.},

abstract = {Activation of ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of single smooth muscle cells from the stomach muscularis of Bufo marinus by caffeine is accompanied by a rise in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i), and the opening of nonselective cationic plasma membrane channels. To understand how each of these pathways contributes to the rise in [Ca2+]i, one needs to separately monitor Ca2+ entry through them. Such information was obtained from simultaneous measurements of ionic currents and [Ca2+]i by the development of a novel and general method to assess the fraction of current induced by an agonist that is carried by Ca2+. Application of this method to the currents induced in these smooth muscle cells by caffeine revealed that approximately 20{\%} of the current passing through the membrane channels activated following caffeine application is carried by Ca2+. Based on this information we found that while Ca2+ entry through these channels rises slowly, release of Ca2+ from stores, while starting at the same time, is much faster and briefer. Detailed quantitative analysis of the Ca2+ release from stores suggests that it most likely decays due to depletion of Ca2+ in those stores. When caffeine was applied twice to a cell with only a brief (30 s) interval in between, the amount of Ca2+ released from stores was markedly diminished following the second caffeine application whereas the current carried in part by Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane was not significantly affected. These and other studies described in the preceding paper indicate that activation of the nonselective cation plasma membrane channels in response to caffeine was not caused as a consequence of emptying of internal Ca2+ stores. Rather, it is proposed that caffeine activates these membrane channels either by direct interaction or alternatively by a linkage between ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the nonselective cation channels on the surface membrane.},

The interplay between the two receptors, itself determined by their organization on the SR, establishes the time course and spatial arrangement of the Ca 2؉ signal. Whether or not the receptors are co-localized or distanced from each other on the same store or whether they exist on separate stores will significantly affect the Ca 2؉ signal produced by the SR. To date these matters remain unresolved. The functional arrangement of the RyR and Ins(1,4,5)P 3 R on the SR has now been examined in isolated single voltage-clamped colonic myocytes. De-pletion of the ryanodine-sensitive store, by repeated ap-plication of caffeine, in the presence of ryanodine, abol-ished the response to Ins(1,4,5)P 3 , suggesting that Ins(1,4,5)P 3 R and RyR share a common Ca 2؉ store.

We hypothesize that Ca2+ is trapped by oligomers of luminal Ca2+-binding proteins and that the opening of release channels induces the rapid liberation of this “concealed” Ca2+ source associated with intra-ER Ca2+ buffers. Our hypothesis may also clarify why SERCA pumps potentiate Ca2+ release and explain quantal characteristics and refractory states of Ca2+ release process.},

abstract = {Calcium signaling is critical for all cells. As a free ion (Ca 2+), calcium links many physiological stimuli to their intracellular effectors by interacting with binding proteins whose occupancy determines the cellular effect of stimulation. Because binding site occupancy depends on the history of Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ]), Ca 2+ dynamics are critical. Calcium dynamics depend on the functional interplay between Ca 2+ transport and buffering systems whose activities depend nonlinearly on [Ca 2+ ]. Thus, understanding Ca 2+ dynamics requires detailed information about these Ca 2+ handling systems and their regulation in intact cells. However, effective methods for measuring and characterizing intracellular Ca 2+ handling have not been available until recently. Using concepts relating voltage-gated ion-channel activity to membrane potential dynamics, we developed such methods to analyze Ca 2+ fluxes in intact cells. Here we describe this approach and applications to under-standing depolarization-induced Ca 2+ responses in sym-pathetic neurons.},

This review summarises recent data on the mechanisms of luminal Ca 2+ - dependent regulation of Ca 2+ release and uptake as well as ER regulation of cellular adaptive processes . In addition we discuss general biophysical properties of the ER membrane , as trans - endomembrane Ca 2+ fluxes are subject to basic electrical forces , determined by factors such as the membrane potential of the ER and the ease with which Ca 2+ fluxes are able to change this potential (i . e . the resistance of the ER membrane) . Although these electrical forces undoubtedly play a fundamental role in shaping [ Ca 2+ ] ER dynamics , at present there is very little direct experimental information about the biophysical properties of the ER membrane . Further studies of how intraluminal [ Ca 2+ ] is regulated , best carried out with direct measurements , are vital for understanding how Ca 2+ orchestrates cell function . Direct monitoring of [ Ca 2+ ] ER under conditions where the cytosolic [ Ca 2+ ] is known may also help to capture elusive biophysical information about the ER , such as the potential difference across the ER membrane .},
