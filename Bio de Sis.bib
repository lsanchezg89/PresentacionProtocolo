abstract = {Living systems must adapt quickly and stably to uncertain environments. A common theme in cellular regulation is the presence of multiple feedback loops in the network. An example of such a feedback structure is regulation of tryptophan concentration in Escherichia coli. Here, three distinct feedback mechanisms, namely genetic regulation, mRNA attenuation and enzyme inhibition, regulate tryptophan synthesis. A pertinent question is whether such multiple feedback loops are "a case of regulatory overkill, or do these different feedback regulators have distinct functions?" Another moot question is how robustness to uncertainties can be achieved structurally through biological interactions. Correlation between the feedback structure and robustness can be systematically studied by tools commonly employed in feedback theory. An analysis of feedback strategies in the tryptophan system in E. coli reveals that the network complexity arising due to the distributed feedback structure is responsible for the rapid and stable response observed even in the presence of system uncertainties.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA was detected which formed a specific hybrid with DNA of the tryptophan region carried by bacteriophage $\phi$80. Since the synthesis of specific messenger RNA corresponds to the genetic properties and physiological activities of the tryptophan genes in Escherichia coli cells, messenger RNA is considered to be specifically related to the genetic information of the tryptophan synthesizing system. Through the hybridization technique with DNA's from $\phi$80 dt0 which carries the entire region of the tryptophan system, and $\phi$80 pt1 which carries the tryptophan region with a deletion of the anthranilic acid synthetase cistron, a specific messenger RNA corresponding to the anthranilic acid synthetase cistron was detected. Because the rate of synthesis of specific tryptophan messenger RNA was reduced by the addition of tryptophan, it is concluded that regulation in the tryptophan system operates at the gene level.},

@article{Bhartiya2006,
abstract = {Biological networks have evolved through adaptation in uncertain environments. Of the different possible design paradigms, some may offer functional advantages over others. These designs can be quantified by the structure of the network resulting from molecular interactions and the parameter values. One may, therefore, like to identify the design motif present in the evolved network that makes it preferable over other alternatives. In this work, we focus on the regulatory networks characterized by serially arranged processes, which are regulated by multiple feedback loops. Specifically, we consider the tryptophan system present in Escherichia coli, which may be conceptualized as three processes in series, namely transcription, translation and tryptophan synthesis. The multiple feedback loop motif results from three distinct negative feedback loops, namely genetic repression, mRNA attenuation and enzyme inhibition. A framework is introduced to identify the key design components of this network responsible for its physiological performance. We demonstrate that the multiple feedback loop motif, as seen in the tryptophan system, enables robust performance to variations in system parameters while maintaining a rapid response to achieve homeostasis. Superior performance, if arising from a design principle, is intrinsic and, therefore, inherent to any similarly designed system, either natural or engineered. An experimental engineering implementation of the multiple feedback loop design on a two-tank system supports the generality of the robust attributes offered by the design.},

@article{Zamora-Chimal2012,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a mathematical model for the tryptophan operon regulatory pathway in Bacillus subtilis. This model considers the transcription-attenuation, and the enzyme-inhibition regulatory mechanisms. Special attention is paid to the estimation of all the model parameters from reported experimental data. With the aid of this model we investigate, from a mathematical-modeling point of view, whether the existing multiplicity of regulatory feedback loops is advantageous in some sense, regarding the dynamic response and the biochemical noise in the system. The tryptophan operon dynamic behavior is studied by means of deterministic numeric simulations, while the biochemical noise is analyzed with the aid of stochastic simulations. The model feasibility is tested comparing its stochastic and deterministic results with experimental reports. Our results for the wildtype and for a couple of mutant bacterial strains suggest that the enzyme-inhibition feedback loop, dynamically accelerates the operon response, and plays a major role in the reduction of biochemical noise. Also, the transcription-attenuation feedback loop makes the trp operon sensitive to changes in the endogenous tryptophan level, and increases the amplitude of the biochemical noise.},

abstract = {A mathematical model was developed for the low and high affinity arabinose transport systems in E. coli. The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations and takes the dynamics of mRNAs for the araE and araFGH proteins and the internal arabinose into account. Special attention was paid to estimate the model parameters from the literature. Our analysis and simulations suggest that the high affinity transport system helps the low affinity transport system to respond to high concentration of extracellular arabinose faster, whereas the high affinity transport system responds to a small amount of extracellular arabinose. Steady state analysis of the model also predicts that there is a regime for the extracellular concentration of arabinose where the arabinose system can show bistable behavior.},

@article{Nguyen2011,
abstract = {Molecular fluctuations are known to affect dynamics of cellular systems in important ways. Studies aimed at understanding how molecular systems of certain regulatory architectures control noise therefore become essential. The interplay between feedback regulation and noise has been previously explored for cellular networks governed by a single negative feedback loop. However, similar issues within networks consisting of more complex regulatory structures remain elusive. The authors investigate how negative feedback loops manage noise within a biochemical cascade concurrently governed by multiple negative feedback loops, using the prokaryotic tryptophan (trp) operon system in Escherechia coli as the model system. To the authors knowledge, this is the first study of noise in the trp operon system. They show that the loops in the trp operon system possess distinct, even opposing, noise-controlling effects despite their seemingly analogous feedback structures. The enzyme inhibition loop, although controlling the last reaction of the cascade, was found to suppress noise not only for the tryptophan output but also for other upstream components. In contrast, the Repression (Rep) loop enhances noise for all systems components. Attenuation (Att) poses intermediate effects by attenuating noise for the upstream components but promoting noise for components downstream of its target. Regarding noise at the output tryptophan, Rep and Att can be categorised as noise-enhancing loops whereas Enzyme Inhibition as a noise-reducing loop. These findings suggest novel implications in how cellular systems with multiple feedback mechanisms control noise. [Includes supplementary material].},
