abstract = {The quantitative modeling of gene transcription and translation requires a treatment of two key features: stochastic fluctuations due to the limited copy numbers of key molecules (genes, RNA polymerases, ribosomes), and delayed output due to the time required for biopolymer synthesis. Recently proposed algorithms allow for efficient simulations of such systems. However, it is critical to know whether the results of delay stochastic simulations agree with those from more detailed models of the transcription and translation processes. We present a generalization of previous delay stochastic simulation algorithms which allows both for multiple delays and for distributions of delay times. We show that delay stochastic simulations closely approximate simulations of a detailed transcription model except when two-body effects (e.g. collisions between polymerases on a template strand) are important. Finally, we study a delay stochastic model of prokaryotic transcription and translation which reproduces observations from a recent experimental study in which a single gene was expressed under the control of a repressed lac promoter in E. coli cells. This demonstrates our ability to quantitatively model gene expression using these new methods.},

abstract = {The small number of reactant molecules involved in gene regula-tion can lead to significant fluctuations in intracellular mRNA and protein concentrations, and there have been numerous recent studies devoted to the consequences of such noise at the regula-tory level. Theoretical and computational work on stochastic gene expression has tended to focus on instantaneous transcriptional and translational events, whereas the role of realistic delay times in these stochastic processes has received little attention. Here, we explore the combined effects of time delay and intrinsic noise on gene regulation. Beginning with a set of biochemical reactions, some of which are delayed, we deduce a truncated master equa-tion for the reactive system and derive an analytical expression for the correlation function and power spectrum. We develop a gen-eralized Gillespie algorithm that accounts for the non-Markovian properties of random biochemical events with delay and compare our analytical findings with simulations. We show how time delay in gene expression can cause a system to be oscillatory even when its deterministic counterpart exhibits no oscillations. We demon-strate how such delay-induced instabilities can compromise the ability of a negative feedback loop to reduce the deleterious effects of noise. Given the prevalence of negative feedback in gene regulation, our findings may lead to new insights related to expression variability at the whole-genome scale.},

@article{Khanin2008,
abstract = {Gene transcription models must take account of intrinsic stochasticity. The Chemical Master Equation framework is based on modelling assumptions that are highly appropriate for this context, and the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (also known as Gillespie's algorithm) allows for practical simulations to be performed. However, for large networks and/or fast reactions, such computations can be prohibitatively expensive. The Chemical Langevin regime replaces the massive ordinary differential equation system with a small stochastic differential equation system that is more amenable to computation. Although the transition from Chemical Master Equation to Chemical Langevin Equation can be justified rigorously in the large system size limit, there is very little guidance available about how closely the two models match for a fixed system. Here, we consider a transcription model from the recent literature and show that it is possible to compare first and second moments in the two stochastic settings. To analyse the Chemical Master Equation we use some recent work of Gadgil, Lee and Othmer, and to analyse the Chemical Langevin Equation we use Ito's Lemma. We find that there is a perfect match—both modelling regimes give the same means, variances and correlations for all components in the system. The model that we analyse involves ‘unimolecular reactions', and we finish with some numerical simulations involving dimerization to show that the means and variances in the two regimes can also be close when more general ‘bimolecular reactions' are involved.},

abstract = {Single-cell and single-molecule measurements indicate the importance of stochastic phenomena in cell biology. Stochasticity creates spontaneous differences in the copy numbers of key macromolecules and the timing of reaction events between genetically-identical cells. Mathematical models are indispensable for the study of phenotypic stochasticity in cellular decision-making and cell survival. There is a demand for versatile, stochastic modeling environments with extensive, preprogrammed statistics functions and plotting capabilities that hide the mathematics from the novice users and offers low-level programming access to the experienced user. Here we present StochPy (Stochastic modeling in Python), which is a flexible software tool for stochastic simulation in cell biology. It provides various stochastic simulation algorithms, SBML support, analyses of the probability distributions of molecule copy numbers and event waiting times, analyses of stochastic time series, and a range of additional statistical functions and plotting facilities for stochastic simulations. We illustrate the functionality of StochPy with stochastic models of gene expression, cell division, and single-molecule enzyme kinetics. StochPy has been successfully tested against the SBML stochastic test suite, passing all tests. StochPy is a comprehensive software package for stochastic simulation of the molecular control networks of living cells. It allows novice and experienced users to study stochastic phenomena in cell biology. The integration with other Python software makes StochPy both a user-friendly and easily extendible simulation tool.},
